## About the Tutoring Group

This is a **remote-only** group intended for folks who want to break into tech and those who want to actively support and tutor.

Let's talk about everything web! Any questions regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are welcome! React and full stack web development questions are fine as well. Let's keep it at a beginners level. Anything discussed or close to 100Devs is within the scope of this meeting!

**What is within the scope of this meetup?**
Let's keep it technical! Every meeting will start and close with some casual small talk where all questions and networking are welcome. However, this meetup is supposed to be about tech tutoring. Questions about HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Express, Databases, and relevant CS theory are welcome!

**Where?** This meetup is remote only!
