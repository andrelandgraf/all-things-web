# All Things Web

This is the repository of the [All Things Web - React and React and HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Tutoring Tutoring](https://www.meetup.com/all-things-web-react-html-css-javascript-tutoring/) - Meetup group!

## About this repository

The folders are ordered by tutoring session. #1 is added for the first session, #2 is added for the second session, etc.

Each folder includes a set of files and a `README.md` file regarding one specific topic. I hope this helps us to find content by tutoring session and topic alike.

## About the Tutoring Group

This is a **remote-only** group intended for folks who want to break into tech and those who want to actively support and tutor.

Let's talk about everything web! Any questions regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are welcome! React and full stack web development questions are fine as well. Let's keep it at a beginners level. Anything discussed or close to 100Devs is within the scope of this meeting!
