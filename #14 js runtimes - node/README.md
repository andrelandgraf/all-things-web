# JavaScript environments

- The browser (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/)
- The server
- Your localhost
- Native stuff
...

=> All environments are based (run on) a JavaScript runtime.

## JavaScript runtime

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- The browser runtimes (Chrome V8, Firefox SpiderMonkey, etc.)
- Deno (https://deno.land/)
- Bun
- Electron / Chrome

## When you develop full stack apps, where do you execute JavaScript?

- Client-side on the browser (during program runtime / execution)
- Server-side on the server (during program runtime / execution)
- During development (think `npm i`, linters, tests, formatters)
- Deploy step (deploy / send code to a server, pipeline, etc.)
- Build step (babel, webpack, build time, think SCSS preprocessor, bundle TypeScript/JavaScript etc.)

## Develop for development

- Tests
- Linting
- Formatting
- Bundling
- Preprocessing
- ...

## Where can you use JavaScript

- In the browser
- For web servers (or Ruby, or PHP, Java Spring, Go, Rust, ....)
